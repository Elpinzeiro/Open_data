# Open_data
## Requirements:
- have Tomcat 7+ installed.

## Step 1
Upload the Libraries webapp (located in the EndPoint folder) to Tomcat as follows:
- copy the compressed [Libraries.war](https://github.com/Elpinzeiro/Open_data/blob/main/EndPoint/Libraries.war) file into the Tomcat "webapps" folder.


## Step 2
Launch Tomcat (from Windows prompt):
- Go to the Tomcat root folder
- then enter the bin folder
- launch the startup (command: path_folder_root_Tomcat / bin / startup)
you can test the correct activation of Tomcat by browsing to localhost: 8080

## Step 3
Launch the [index](https://github.com/Elpinzeiro/Open_data/blob/main/website/OpenData/index.html) web page, inside the SitoWeb / OpenData folder.
